# Web-Analyzer-Project-2
In Project 1, we computed some statistics on the resources that are served. In this Project, we incorporate client-requests, and compute related statistics.

For this project, we have inputs from 3 sources. (1) Web-resources that are served are input from a file, as in Project 1. (2) A command-line argument is provided, which we call a bias (discussed below).(3) Client-requests are provided as user-input, to be read in by the program as it runs. 

Input file: The input file is named ece150-input.txt. Its format is the same as Project 1.
